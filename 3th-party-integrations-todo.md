As more and more places stop support for Magento1 integrations in favor of M2, there is a plan needed on how to restore some of them to stay competitive.




## List of previous Integrations

A list of Services with notes about the integrations 

### Klaviyo

A Marketing Integration

Might be resolved by them adding the "urn:OpenMage" on their side.

### LiveAgent

have still an integration for M2
https://www.liveagent.com/integrations/magento/

seems to be mostly about fetching Customer and Order Data to display in their Helpdesk

### Facebook


## possible approaches and things to make reestablishing this integrations easier

recreate M2 (or other platforms) APIs, to hijack existing integrations? ðŸ‘€
