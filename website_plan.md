## Target Usecases / Target Audiences

Several usecases we found so far. 
Might we need "Landing Pages" for each of them? So we can have the main page focused for marketing the Project, and direct most people easily to dedicated Pages where they find easier what they are looking for,

### existing users looking for support and developers

relevant Pages:

* list of freelancers
* list of agencies
* list of hosters?

relevant links (probably need a dedicated page to put into context):

* links to stackexchange, github discussions, discord 
* links to websites for small jobs? (I dont know how they are called)

relevant search Terms?

* 
* 

### learning about future plans, focus, roadmap

relevant Pages

* Focus Page with established Project Goals ( https://github.com/OpenMage/organizational/blob/main/Goals.md )
* Roadmap listing already decided new Changes for upcoming Versions (probably only containing the ones we have at least 50% confidence of finishing in time)
* blog with semi regular posts about sub projects we are kicking off (for example removing an outdated js library, creating a new Theme, PHP Version updates)

### staying updated about new changes and achivements in the project

summary of the most relevant changelog entries, could probably get covered by the Blog

While Devs can check directly the Changelog, for more business focused people and even more sales people a simplified summary is a benefit. Could then also get a bit decorated with marketing speach.

### undecided people finding out what we can offer for new Setups and Shops

Thats a possibly problematic point, as we lack in features and integrations in many areas.
Highlighting our strengths would probably cover only the low cost in hosting and maintenance?

### new people/devs wanting to try out the project

* link to demo page
* short/simple tutorial to setup the project on local
* extended tutorial for a best practice setup
* tutorial for non-devs?

### people wanting to contribute to the project

We do have a link to the Github Page, and also a Contributor Guideline. But besides the main repository there is so much more we do need support with. It might be good to have a dedicated landing page giving an overview.



## other usecases / Flows

### A place to highlight supporting companies?

### showcase some of the unique Features we have to shine?


## initial note

There are a lot of separate issues which we probably should approach with the website.
One issue I see is, that we need to define the actual  target audiences going on this website, and what they are looking for.
Back then for me was the primary goal the People checking out the project for the first time, or which are in the phase of deciding if OpenMage is an acceptable alternative.

This changed by now, but also we have now multiple target audiences.
I think its these
existing users looking for support and developers
learning about future plans and focus
staying updated about new changes in the project
undecided people finding out what we can offer for new Setups and Shops
new people/devs wanting to try out the project

at least thats what I think of initially, there are sure more.
And we should take these groups into account for every step we do in redesigning, even if we have to duplicate some of the content.
