## Context

to make a rough planing, and estimate of founding goals possible we need to put some numbers on various things we want to use this founding for.
Additionally, we need an order for possible expenses, as we will for a while not have guaranteed available founding.


# Planned expenses

## Level 1

### Release Creation

Creation of new Releases is one of the most important tasks for a software to make it actually available in an ordered way.
The time needed for Releases might differ, so the actual payout might in parts be higher.
It may also be relevant, when security releases are needed.

4,000$ per Quarter

### Process / Review / Solve reported Security risks

We have a rare but steady stream of security reports.
Processing these takes time, and bringing solutions into our main branch even more.
Additionally with this budget we could take on some of the lower reported issues which currently are more usability issues.

4,000$ per Quarter


## Level 2

### Extend and Refine our automated Testing

Tests ensure persistent stability

8,000$ per Quarter

### investigate and resolve older or more complicated issues

While we get a lot of volunteer contributions, there are some issues which are to complex or need more time for investigation, trying and development.
The results will still be usefull, but exeed what is possible for most volunteers.

8,000$ per Quarter

### maintaining the organisatorical and transparency information

serving the transparency needed will be an important part when money is involved. But its also something which takes effort and time.

2.000$ per Quarter

## Level 3

### Fulltime Developer

Have a developer working Fulltime on various ToDos.
The way we would do or organize it is still open and depends on the People already close to the project and their availability.
The Sum is not what we will pay directly, but what we should reserve as Budget, and might likely be used more flexible.

20,000$ per quarter

### Technical writing for our Documentation

5.000$ per quarter


## Onetime Projects which might need founding
